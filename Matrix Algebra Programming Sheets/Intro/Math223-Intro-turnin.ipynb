What you are just reading is an example of a Jupyter notebook.  A Jupyter notebook lets you combine rich text (entered in a version of the _markdown_ syntax) with math formulas (entered in the $\\LaTeX$ syntax) and calculations in a supported programming language, in this case Julia."

Carefully edit the text so that every occurence of 100 will become 200.  Make sure you do not change anything else, unless you know what you are doing (if you know _markdown_ and $\\LaTeX$ syntax, you may want to experiment more).

By following this advice, you will avoid looking at your notebooks couple months later and scratching your had in confusion, trying to figure out what in the world is going on there.\n",

There is a huge numbers of LaTeX tutorials on the web, but most of them deal with the full $\\LaTeX$ system, designed for typesetting complete mathematical documents such as articles or books.  For our purposes we just need to learn a subset of LaTeX that will let us type formulas into the nonotebooks.
