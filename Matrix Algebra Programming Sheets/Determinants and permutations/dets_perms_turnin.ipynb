    "Now this is interesting.  What is going on here?\n",

    "To understand the difference encountered here, we need to realize that the permutation method for calculating determinants is, especially for large matrices, extremely inefficient.  The number of permutation needed grows very quickly with the size of the matrix, so that using the new method for matrices larger than $4\\times 4$ is really impractical.   It works very well for $3\\times 3$ matrices (in fact, we used it for $3\\times 3$ matrices before, we just did not mention it), and it gives us a formula for determinants that can be used for theoretical derivations of other methods and theorems, but __nobody should use it to actually calculate determinants of large matrices__.  The methods used by Julia's `det` function depend somewhat on the properties of the actual matrix, but they are based on Gauss elimination, and usually involve division.  Dividing integers generally results in floating point numbers, and calculations with floating point numbers often involve small rounding errors.  As you can see, the error is extremely small, around 0.000000000000002."
