Write a C++ program with the following features-

1. One base class called "Student" contains the student ID (int), first name (string or char array) and one public function (give any name) to initialize these.

2. One derived class called "CS216" inherits some or all members (you have to decide about the access specifier) of Student class members  and in addition contains Quiz1 grade (float), Quiz2 grade (float), one public function (give any name) to initialize these, one function to find the average of the quiz scores, one function to show the output.

3. One derived class called "CS216Midterm" inherits some or all members (you have to decide about the access specifier) of CS216 class members  and in addition contains MidtermPart1 grade (float), MidtermPart2 grade (float), one public function (give any name) to initialize these, one function to find the average of the Part1 and Part2 scores, one function to show the output.

3. User will enter the First name, ID, Quiz1 score, Quiz2, MidtermPart1, MidtermPart2 score from keyboard (all input operations got to be handled from main function) and the program will generate the average quiz score along with the first name and ID. Output operations must be handled from the derived class.
