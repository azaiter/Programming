# CS 216: Computer Programming II

# Course Description:

This course continues the development of computer programming techniques introduced in CS 116. Topics include data abstraction, object-oriented programming, linear and nonlinear data structures and analysis of sort and search routines including inheritance, polymorphism, pointers, recursion lists, linked-lists, stacks, queues and binary trees.

# Course Objectives:

Upon completing this course the students to be able to:

Conitune to develop the knowledge and skill for applying the object-oriented design methodology to solve a problem.
Increase proficiency in C++ programming language, particularly with regard to the class construct, inheritance, function and operator overloading, pointers, dynamic memory allocation and recursion.
Use data abstraction, other other than built-in data structures in C++, such as linked-list, stacks, queues, and binary trees.
Analyze elementary and advanced sorting routines and searching algorithms.
