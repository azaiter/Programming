HW2

Problem 1.

Write a C++ program to swap two integer numbers using pointer(s). Two numbers will be taken from keyboard and stored in an integer array (of size two)      ---- 10 points

The program must show the output on screen. Therefore, no file I/O required.

Sample input: (taken form keyboard) 

23

11

Sample output: (on screen)

Before swapping: First number = 23 and Second number = 11

After swapping: First number = 11 and Second number = 23

 

Problem 2

Write a program in C++ that takes five floating-point numbers from the keyboard, stores them in an array and then doubles the contents. 

Conditions:

-- No array indexing allowed anywhere in the program. Example: any statement like "array[X]" can't be used. You have to use pointers to access the array elements.

-- You have to use a function to double the contents of the array. The function must take the address (pointer) of the array as a parameter.

The program must take inputs from keyboard and show the outputs on screen. Therefore, no file I/O required.

 

 

Sample input: (taken form keyboard) 

23.4  34.6  12.2

Sample output: (on screen)

46.8  69.2  24.4

 

Problem 3: 

Write a C++ program to reverse the characters in a "char" array using pointer(s). Your program must have a function called "reverse_array()" which receives the beginning address of the array (which is to be declared inside main function) as argument.  

The program must take inputs from keyboard and show the outputs on screen. Therefore, no file I/O required.     

Sample input: (taken form keyboard) 

Hello world

 

Sample output: (on screen)
