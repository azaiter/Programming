One derived class called "CS216" inherits some or all members (you have to decide about the access specifier) of Student class members  and in addition contains Quiz1 grade (float), Quiz2 grade (float), one public function (give any name) to initialize these, one function to find the average of the quiz scores, one function to show the output.
