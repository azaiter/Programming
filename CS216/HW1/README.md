HW1

Problem 1: Turn in CW1 if you have not done it before. You will be considered for upto 80% credits now.

Problem 2: Write a program in C++ to compute the volume of an 3-dimensional box. The volume is calculated by multiplying 3 dimension values. The program must have the followings:

1. A class named Box,

2. Constructor function that initializes the dimensions,

3. Private dimension variables.

Inputs (3 dimension values separated by space) are to be taken from inside the main() function through a file. The file will have multiple lines where each line represents information about one box. The program will show the outputs on the screen (console).

 

Sample Input (from file):

12.3 4 3

4 6.7 6

1 2 3

 

Sample output (on screen):

Box 1 volume: 147.6

Box 2 volume: 160.8

Box 3 volume: 6

Problem 2 submission must follow the instructions given in the syllabus. The evaluation guidelines will be strictly followed. Refer to the "Programming Evaluation" section in syllabus. Prepare all the documents (example: NS chart etc.) mentioned there.
