HW3

Problem 1: Write a C++ program to find the division of two numbers (int or float or double) using function overloading. The program must have the three separate functions (one for int, one for float and one for double data types) named "divN(x, y)" which will return the division of x and y.

 

Sample input:

Enter your choice: 1 for int, 2 for float, 3 for double

1

Enter two integers:

2   3 

 

Sample output:

0.6666667

 

Problem 2: Add exception handling in the previous (Problem1) code. There should have three catch handlers for three data types (int, float, double). The handlers should address the divide by zero issue. 

Sample input:

Enter your choice: 1 for int, 2 for float, 3 for double

3

Enter two doubles:

2.1   0

 

Sample output:

Error!! Cannot divide by zero!!
