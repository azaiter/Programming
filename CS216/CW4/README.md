This assignment was locked Feb 29 at 11:35am.
Read the topics Diamond Problem, Virtual Inheritance and the sample codes from the link given below:

http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/c-cplusplus/diamond-problem/ (Links to an external site.)

 

Now extend/modify the CW3 problem as follows:

- add another class "CS316" that inherits some or all members of Student class members  and in addition contains Quiz1 grade (float), Quiz2 grade (float), one public function (give any name) to initialize these, one function to find the average of the quiz scores, one function to show the output

- change the name "CS216Midterm" class to "Midterm" and that inherits some or all members of both CS216 and CS316 classes. In addition it contains MidtermPart1 grade (float), MidtermPart2 grade (float), one public function (give any name) to initialize these, one function to find the average of the Part1 and Part2 scores, one function to show the output.

- use the idea of virtual Inheritance to solve the Diamond Problem arised here 

 

Sample Input:

Enter the First name: Chris

Enter the ID: 123456

Enter CS316 Quiz1 score: 95.5

Enter CS316 Quiz2 score: 80

nter CS216 Quiz1 score: 100

Enter CS216 Quiz2 score: 90

Enter Midterm Part1 score: 45

Enter Midterm Part2 score: 50

 

Sample Output:

Chris's (ID: 123456) average quiz score in CS316 is 87.75,  average quiz score in CS216 is 95 and average midterm score is 47.5
